          <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
            When I co-founded We Dine Together at my high school, I didn't realize I was starting a global movement. Over time, I discovered that the biggest barrier to becoming a movement leader isn't externalâ€”it's the false beliefs, stories, and identities you hold onto. Through confronting conflict and stepping outside my comfort zone, I cultivated connections and increased my influence, becoming the movement I was created to be. Now I help you do the same.
